## Testing

A testing suite has been provided for you, checking for all essential functionality and
edge cases.

To run these tests, first open the root project directory in your terminal. Then run `npm install` to install
all necessary testing dependencies (you will only need to do this step once).
Finally, run `npm run test`. You will see a list of tests that ran with information
about whether or not each test passed. After this list, you will see more specific output
about why each failing test failed.

As you implement functionality, run the tests to
ensure you are creating correctly named variables and functions that return the proper values.
The tests will additionally help you identify edge cases that you may not have anticipated
when first writing the functions.
